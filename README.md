# Pushdown Automata

Animated visual toolkit for pushdown automata.
The centre of this project is the design and development of an animated visual simulator for pushdown automata, together with a GUI suitable for using the simulator as an educational tool for beginners. The suggested implementation language is JAVA or C++, but other high level languages would also be possible. A collection of good examples (preferably in XML format) should also be constructed.
